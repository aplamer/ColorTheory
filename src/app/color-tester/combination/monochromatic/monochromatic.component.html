    A <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Monochromatic</span> relationship
    is simply a single hue on the color wheel, though as with all other color relationships value and saturation can be varied to create a sense of form. 
    A Monochromatic combination should be used to create cohesion and union within a piece.
